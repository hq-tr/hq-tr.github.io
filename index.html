    <h3 class="text-box-title">About</h3>
      <p> I have recently successfully defended my PhD thesis at <a href="https://ntu.edu.sg/spms" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University</a> in Singapore. In my thesis I investigated the dynamical and braiding properties of anyons (quasiholes) in fractional quantum Hall states. My research is focused on the traditional 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) systems, and is based heavily on numerical calculations. At the moment I am interested in behaviours of non-Abelian anyons under realistic interactions, and I am looking for ways to incorporate GPUs to improve numerical routines, i.e. going to larger systems. So far, the latter tasks seem to need a lot of work, however. I am also interested in elementary excitations in other similar systems e.g. fractional Chern insulators.

      <p>Fixing the position of four Ising anyons (quasiholes of the Pfaffian state in this case) gives two orthonormal states. Here is what they look like on the disk. What does this tell us? Not much for now, but it's fun to look at.</p>

      <p>It's not that I don't know how to make a modern-looking website. I grew up with the internet in the 2000s and I like the look of the Old Web.</p>
